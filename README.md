Smartphone Carbon Emission Analysis 📱🌍

This repository contains a personal mini-project aimed at quantifying and analyzing the carbon footprint generated through daily smartphone usage. It highlights how seemingly small actions—charging, gaming, internet usage—can cumulatively contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.

📌 Project Overview

Smartphones are indispensable in modern life, but their energy consumption contributes to environmental impact. This project tracks and analyzes emissions from personal smartphone use over a period of February 16, 2025 – March 14, 2025, with the goal of promoting mindful digital habits.

🎯 Objectives

- Measure daily smartphone usage across:
    -📱 Screen Time
    
    -🔌 Charging Hours
    
    -🌐 Internet Usage (Mobile Data & Wi-Fi)
    
    -🎮 Gaming Hours

- Calculate corresponding carbon emissions (kg CO₂).

- Visualize trends using Power BI dashboards.

- Recommend actionable strategies to reduce emissions.


📊 Dataset & Methodology

- Tracking Period: 16th Feb – 14th Mar, 2025

- Tools Used: Excel (for data logging), Power BI (for visualization)

- Emission Factors:

    - Charging: 0.0045 kg CO₂/hour
    
    - Mobile Data: 0.5 kg CO₂/GB
    
    - Wi-Fi: 0.1 kg CO₂/GB
    
    - Gaming: 0.009 kg CO₂/hour

The dataset records daily screen time, charging hours, internet usage (split by type), and gaming duration. A total emission per day is calculated based on the emission factors.


📈 Key Findings:
- Total CO₂ Emitted: 14.05 kg over 27 days

- Average Daily Emission: ~0.50 kg CO₂

- Max Emission Day: 28-Feb-2025 (0.73 kg CO₂)

- Average Screen Time: 6.06 hours/day

High screen and gaming times directly correlated with increased emissions. Mobile data usage contributed significantly more than Wi-Fi due to higher emission rates.


📊 Power BI Dashboard Insights:

📌 KPIs: Total Emission, Avg. Screen Time, Max Emission Day

📊 Bar Chart: Daily Screen vs Charging Time

📉 Combo Chart: Data Usage (Mobile/Wi-Fi) vs Emissions

📦 Stacked Chart: Emission Source Breakdown
